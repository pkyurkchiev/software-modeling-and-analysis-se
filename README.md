## Introduction to Software modeling and analysis
<sup>This repository is part of the **Software modeling and analysis course** for regular students of Software Engineering at Plovdiv University.</sup>\
The course is designed to provide an overview of the principles of building a database model according to the program specifications for software projects. Defining a conceptual, logical, and physical model of the data allows verification of program specifications and a better understanding of data flow and management methods from all parties in the project.

Course participants are introduced to the theory and formal processes of data modeling for various purposes.
